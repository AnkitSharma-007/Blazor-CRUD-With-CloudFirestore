# Blazor-CRUD-With-CloudFirestore
In this article, we will create a Blazor application using Google Firstore as database provider. We will create a Single Page Application (SPA) and perform CRUD operations on it. We will use a form to accept the user inputs. The form will have client-side validations and also contains a dropdown list, which will bind to a collection in our database.

We will use Visual Studio 2019.
